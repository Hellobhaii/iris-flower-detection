# 🌼 Iris Flower Detection (Machine Learning Project)

This project predicts the **species of an Iris flower** (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using a trained machine learning model.

---

## 🔍 Overview

- Loads the Iris dataset  
- Trains a classification model  
- Evaluates accuracy  
- Saves the trained model  
- Allows predictions using sepal & petal measurements

---

## 🛠 Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Train the Model

```bash
python src/train.py
```

---

## 🔮 Make Predictions

```bash
python src/predict.py 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2
```

Example Output:

```
Predicted Species: Iris-setosa
```
